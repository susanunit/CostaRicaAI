ðŸ”¹ Logistic Regression
Data Characteristics it Loves:
Features have a linear relationship with the target outcome.


The dataset isnâ€™t too noisy or high-dimensional.


Features are independent of each other (low multicollinearity).


Small to medium-sized datasets (thousands to tens of thousands of rows).


What Breaks It:
Non-linear patterns in data.


Complex interactions between features.


Outliers that throw off the linear boundary.


Imbalanced classes (fixable, but needs adjustments).


Checklist:

*  âœ… Numeric or binary features
*  âœ… No heavy feature interaction
*  âœ… Task demands interpretability
